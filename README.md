RELION Tutorial Simplified
==========================

![images/intro-illust.png](images/intro-illust.png)

This is a simplified version of [the RELION 3.0 tutorial](https://bit.ly/2mgzoQA) for single particle analysis created by Sjors H.W. Scheres. The purpose of this tutorial is to make the RELION workflow clear and understandable for those who have no relations to electronic microscopy but might want to try to get in using RELION.

With RELION, you can build a 3D model of a particle from a set of the 2D micro-photography images (micrographs). It can help to find similar particles on other micrographs faster, and also can boost up further particle research.

The tutorial contains a simplified description of each step of the original tutorial, recommendations about how to get the best results, and explanation of results. Also, it includes links to additional references for cryo-EM terms like beam-induced motion-correction, CTF estimation, Bayesian polishing, and others.


## Parameters

The values for RELION parameters from the original tutorial were taken as the base. Still, at some steps values may be different from the values of the original tutorial.


## Cluster specs

We used the HPC cluster with the following specs for computations.

- CPU: Intel Xeon Gold 6230 Cascadelake (2.1GHz, 20Cores) x2
- Cores: 640
- MEM/node: 192GB
- Total Memory: 4.6TB
- GPU: N/A
- Number of Compute nodes: 16
- Interconnect: Intel Omni-Path 100Gbps
- File system: BeeGFS
